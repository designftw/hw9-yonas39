    <h1>Figma Mockup</h1>
    <p>
      Conducting user testing on the paper prototype before moving on to the
      Figma interactive prototype allowed me to identify areas of the design
      that needed improvement and to gather feedback from potential users. Based
      on the feedback I received, I improved the design using Figma. By creating
      a high-fidelity prototype that more accurately reflects the final product,
      I was able to simulate the user experience much more effectively and
      uncover potential usability issues early in the design process. I added
      custom animations, transitions, and interactive elements to create a more
      engaging and intuitive user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using Figma, I was able to iterate on the design quickly and gather
      feedback from myself as a user in real-time. The Figma prototype allowed
      me to implement the changes necessary to create a more polished and
      effective design that caters to the user's specific needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, by combining the user's testing input from the paper
      prototype, I improved the learnability of my design with proper labeling.
      Implement some safety features by not allowing users to select some tasks
      on specific pages without completing prior requirements.
