            The goal of this project is to design an app that helps users manage
            their expenses in a more user-friendly way than using a spreadsheet.
            As a usability-minded friend with web development experience, I will
            create a wireframe UI using HTML that showcases what the app would
            look like with representative data. The focus is on designing an
            interface that is easy to use and navigate, without worrying about
            implementation or CSS.

            This application is designed to help DesignFTW students calculate
            their final project grades in the class. Students will enter their
            participation grade for the studio, feedback, and other
            participation, as well as grades for each homework and see their
            final grade as numbers 0-100.
