          <p>
            My name is Yonas Mekonnen, I am an ambitious and enthusiastic
            computer science and engineering student at the Massachusetts
            Institute of Technology. I am passionate about leveraging technology
            to tackle real-world issues. My academic background has exposed me
            to various programming languages, software development
            methodologies, and systems design.
            <br />
            Currently, I am attending design for the web class. Sofar I have
            completed four projects. You can click on the Portfolio button and
            find all the projects I have completed sofar.

            The goal of this project is to design an app that helps users manage
            their expenses in a more user-friendly way than using a spreadsheet.
            As a usability-minded friend with web development experience, I will
            create a wireframe UI using HTML that showcases what the app would
            look like with representative data. The focus is on designing an
            interface that is easy to use and navigate, without worrying about
            implementation or CSS.
